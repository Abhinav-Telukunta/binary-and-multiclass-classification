Given chest xray images of various classes like **Normal**, **COVID-19**, **ARDS**, **SARS** and **Streptococcus**, our task is to develop and build a classifier which
classifies the images accurately using the weights of pre-trained networks like **VGG16** and **ResNet50** (Transfer Learning).

For binary classification classes used - **Normal** and **COVID-19**.

For multiclass classification classes used - **Normal**, **COVID-19**, **ARDS**, **SARS** and **Streptococcus**.
